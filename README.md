Milestone 1 README

Proposed Level of Achievement:
Apollo 11

Motivation:
We are interested in food and cooking and we want to create a community of like-minded individuals with a passion for cooking and sharing recipes. Currently there are many individual blogs/youtube channels that teach how to cook, but with a platform like ours, it allows individuals to collate and provide feedback for various recipes so that they are “tried and tested”, while allowing us to share our tried and tested recipes with the community.

Aim:
We hope to make a platform to showcase our recipes and for foodies to share their recipes and engage with one another through our forum platform.

User Stories:
As a foodie looking for new recipes, I want to easily search for recipes based on food types and cuisine.
As someone who is new to cooking, I want to be able to ask the owner of the recipe specific questions / interact with the owner of the recipe.
As a foodie, I want to be updated on the latest news regarding promotions/the opening of new food places.
As someone who’s going to cook, I would like to be able to easily know how much I need depending on the number of people I’m going to serve.
